-- This information provides insights into the number of participants within each dataset,

-- The activity dataset consists of 33 participants each, while the sleep dataset includes 24 participants. However, the weight dataset only has 8 participants. It is worth noting that the limited number of participants in the weight dataset may not be sufficient to draw meaningful recommendations or conclusions based on this data.

-- Now, let's examine the summary statistics of the datasets.

-- We can find some interesting insights here the average distance is 5.4997, this means that the average calories is 2303.1648, 
the Lightly Active Minutes has average 192.81 minutes, Fairly Active minutes 13.5648 and Very Active Minutes 21.16
that means that the casual person is our user, but we have some high performance athlete has a 210 minutes in this intensity 
as well that mean a high calories with 4900 calories, the average weight is 72 KG or 158.81 pounds, minimum 52.59 KG or 115.93 pounds 
the maximum is 133.5 KG or 296.31 pounds, other insight is the difference Total Time In Bed is 458.63 minutes or 7.64 hours, 
but the real time that they are asleep is 419.46 minutes or 6.99 hours our users are very close to have a healthy time of sleep, 
they took 39.17 minutes to sleep, as well the minimum is 61 minutes in bed and he sleep 58 minutes, thats not very healthy for our customer, 
the maximum was 961 minutes in bed or 16.01 hours in bed, probably some injury or he is in the hospital,  the maximum time asleep was 13.2667 
our user has hypersomnia thats not very healthy for him.
